This is a program intended to make champion selection in an online game, league of legends, easier for the end user.

We compare champion stats versus other champions, with champions already picked for your team, your own personal favorite champions, and the champions that are strong in the current game to find the best possible picks, which we display via a sorted selection index.

This should make solo queue more satisfying in some cases, but will be better employed in 5v5 competetive or casual play, where the intent of the entire team, or both teams, can be made known.
